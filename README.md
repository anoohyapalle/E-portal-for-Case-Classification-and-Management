The aim of this mini project is to develop an e-portal which is capable of taking an input pdf file (case 
sheet) from the client; read and analyse the file with the help of Natural Language Processing libraries 
or related libraries; categorise the type of case and further provide case related lawyers to the clients 
along with a provision to have an appointment booked with the corresponding lawyer of their case. 
This portal is created in such a way that it provides user friendly navigation, highly secured and 
centralized database to safeguard the data provided by both the lawyers as well as the clients. A register 
or login page is provided for both the lawyers as well as the clients to enter their credentials as well as 
their details; they can edit this information whenever required. The lawyer as well as the client are 
provided with a choice to choose their own lawyer and client. 
This portal is designed in such a way that it can be easily understood and redirects you to the required 
page of your choice. User friendly navigation, interactive features, informative displays, interaction 
between lawyers as well as the clients is provided.By automating tedious tasks, facilitating informed 
decision-making, and enhancing accessibility to legal services, the proposed e-portal promises to 
optimize workflow efficiency and empower both clients and legal professionals.
